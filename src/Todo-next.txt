Next steps for new movement system+IS
=====================================

Keep a single machine position, based on current motor positions, not one per MS
then Implement Move::SetAxisEndPosition

Segment generation code to store values in steps not mm in MoveSegment

Implement remaining missing functions

Eventually, store end position in segments. End positions specified by user must be exact numbers of motor steps. Segment boundaries may be fractional steps.
