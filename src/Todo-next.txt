Next steps for new movement system+IS
=====================================

[done] Set Move.CheckEndstops when executing movement that checks endstops or a Z probe

If a move checks endstops and the endstop is already triggered during Prepare, it remains busy for the length of the homing move, even though it doesn't move

[done] DM must init and maintain (existing) flag isExtruder

Take account of raw motor moves when deciding whether to use IS. Maybe move useIS into MovementFlags?

[done] Init DM.segFlags when starting a new segment, clear it when we run out of segments

Can we keep a single machine position, based on current motor positions, not one per MS?

Eventually, store end position in segments. End positions specified by user must be exact numbers of motor steps. Segment boundaries may be fractional steps.

Fix ExtruderPrintingSince, need to update variable extruderPrintingSince when we start a prinitng extruder move after not doing one

Use cumulativeHiccupTime and notify hiccups to expansion boards
Allow for expansion boards introducing hiccups

Set up params.useInputShaping, needed for CAN
