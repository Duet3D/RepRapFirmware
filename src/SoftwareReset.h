// The SAM3X and SAM4E don't have EEPROM so we save the data to flash. This unfortunately means that it gets cleared
// every time we reprogram the firmware via bossa, but it can be retained when firmware updates are performed
// via the web interface. That's why it's a good idea to implement versioning here - increase these values
// whenever the fields of the following structs have changed.
//
// The SAM4E has a large page erase size (8K). For this reason we store the software reset data in the 512-byte user signature area
// instead, which doesn't get cleared when the Erase button is pressed. The SoftareResetData struct must have at least one 32-bit
// field to guarantee that values of this type will be 32-bit aligned. It must have no virtual members because it is read/written
// directly from/to flash memory.
