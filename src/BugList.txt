- check that we never enable the drivers before we set vsense

- [don't do] Don't report the motor current for a non-existent extruder
- dual extrusion layer counting, see https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=34816#p34816
- M140/M190 with no P parameter sets all bed heater temperatures (same for M141/M191)
- M291 to lock movement and wait for it to finish?
- Add timeout to hsmci_send_cmd_execute, see https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=35654#p35654
- Bug: pressure advance attempts high speed or acceleration extruder movements on bench setup (was it caused by hitting limits?)
- Bug: https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=34772#p34772 (needs RRF fix too?)
- M40 to run eject.g [don't do, not NIST standard?]
- configurable minimum extrusion temperature (per extruder?)
- case-insensitive http headers

- Send reduce power command to PanelDue when main power turned off?
- Document multiple bed and chamber heaters
- [mostly done] Check all classes for correct initialisation

Bug investigations:
- [done] step errors, https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=33741#p33741
- [no fault, possibly related to low extruder steps/mm] SeeMeCNC scaling problem, see email of 2018-04-01

Investigations:

[done, waiting forever for SD card] Investigate https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=32237#p32237
[done] https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=30414#p30414 (watchdog reset)
[can't reproduce] https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=28210#p28210 (pressure advance causes over extrusion)
[done] https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=28255#p28255 (tool change problem)
[done] https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=30431#p30431 (bed probing inaccurate)
[can't reproduce] https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=30799#p30799 (step errors at high E steps/mm)
[no fault] https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=30851#p30851 (split axis motor goes the wrong way)
[done BUT still wrong in lwip 2] inconsistend oversize vs. len
p->ref == 1 in WiFi

Later versions:

- Check https://www.duet3d.com/forum/thread.php?pid=33951#p33951

- Option to not broadcast SSID?
- Support faster homing by using interrupts to check homing switch states
- Allow manual bed probing to be aborted
- Don't do pressure advance during accel/decel of sequences of short segments
- Arc move with same finish and start coordinates to do complete circle
- Add T parameter to M207
- look at supporting SIZE in FTP
- Make mp.delta.hmz0sK, hmz0scK and dsk 64-bit in SAM4E versions, to increase movement limit - also increase K2?
