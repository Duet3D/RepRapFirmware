// Class to implement a software timer with a few microseconds resolution
// Important! In systems that use 16-bit timers, callbacks may take place at multiples of 65536 ticks before they are actually due.
// In order to achieve the maximum step rate possible, the timer code doesn't check for this, because the step generation code checks which drivers are due steps anyway.
// Any other client that uses the timer MUST do a similar check. The simple way to do this is to use a callback function of the following form:
// if (timer.ScheduleCallbackFromIsr()) { /* code to execute it the callback really was due */ }
