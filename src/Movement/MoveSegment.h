 *
 * This class holds the parameters of a segment of a move with constant acceleration.
 * In order to handle input shaping we need to superimpose segments. This means we have to store the basic parameters.
 * The distance travelled when acceleration is a and initial speed is u is:
 *
 *		s = u*t + 0.5*a*t^2
 *
 * After n steps we want to achieve this distance plus any outstanding movement when the move started. So if q is the mm per step then:
 *
 * 		n*q = s0 + u*t + 0.5*a*t^2
 *
 * The segment parameters are therefore s0, u and a. We also store the start time t0, the segment duration td, and the segment length d.
 * We don't need to store s0 in the segment, instead we accumulate it in the DriveMovement object.
 * We save memory by not storing u. If needed we calculate it from:
 *
 * 		u = (d - 0.5*a*td^2)/td = d/td - 0.5*a*td
 *
 * We can superimpose two segments that start at the same times t0 by adding the s0, u and a parameters.
 * If the segments start and/or end at different times then we must split one or both into two or three segments so that we can superimpose segments with the same times.
 *
 * If S-curve acceleration is supported then a becomes the initial acceleration and we have an additional parameter j which is the rate of change of acceleration. Distance travelled is:
 *
 * 		s = u*t + 0.5*a*t^2 + (1/6)*j*t^3
 *
 * Again, we don't store u because we can calculate it from:
 *
 * 		u = (d - 0.5*a*td^2 - (1/6)*j*td^3)/td = d/td - 0.5*a*td - (1/6)*j*td^2

		// 1. The maximum value that can be represented by a float is a little more than 3.4e38, so t0 values greater than about 1e19 cause trouble when we square them to calculate q.
		// 2. Rounding error may cause large errors in the step time, when t0 can't represented to within a small number of step clocks
		// Issue #2 causes problems when abs(t0) exceeds about 2^24 because then the number of step clocks can't be represented exactly.
		// Here are two possible ways round this:
		// 1. When t0 gets large we could use the Maclaurin expansion of sqrt(q - p*n) to give:
		//    time_from_segment_start ~= p*n/(2 * sqrt(q + p*n))
		// This is accurate to within about 1 clock on the last step N when (p*N)^4 < 8*(q + p*N)^3
		// so approximately when (p*N)^4 < 8*q^3, or very roughly when p*N << q
		// However, using the Maclaurin expansion requires an extra division in each step calculation, which we would prefer to avoid.
