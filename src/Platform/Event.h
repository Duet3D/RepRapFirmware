 *
 * This class manages events. An event is an occurrence reported by a machine sensor that may need to be reported or may require action to be taken.
 * The various event types are listed in file CANlib/RRF3Common.h.
 * When an event on a main board occurs, a corresponding Event object is created and added to the event queue, unless there is a similar event already in the queue.
 * When an event on an expansion board occurs, it is transmitted to the main board over CAN and then treated in the same way as a main board event.
 * The event queue is kept in priority order, with the highest priority event at the head of the queue; except that if the event at the head of the queue is
 * being processed, it remains at the head of the queue until processing is complete. Leaving it in the queue while it is being processed allows other similar
 * events to be ignored.
 *
 * The event queue is emptied by the AutoPause GCode channel. It flags the entry at the head of the queue as being processed, takes whatever action is needed,
 * and removes it from the queue.
 *
 * A main board power failure bypasses the event mechanism. Triggers do not use the event mechanism.
