// MAX31855 thermocouple chip
//
// The MAX31855 continuously samples a Type K thermocouple.  When the MAX31855
// is selected via its chip select (CS) pin, it unconditionally writes a 32 bit
// sequence onto the bus.  This sequence is designed such that we need only
// interpret the high 16 bits in order to ascertain the temperature reading and
// whether there a fault condition exists.  The low 16 bits provide the
// MAX31855's cold junction temperature (and thus the board temperature) as
// well as finer detail on any existing fault condition.
//
// The temperature read from the chip is a signed, two's-complement integer.
// As it is a 14 bit value (in units of one-quarter degrees Celsius), we
// convert it to a proper signed 16 bit value by adding two high bits.  The
// high bits added should both be zero if the value is positive (highest bit
// of the 14 bit value is zero), or both be one if the value is negative
// (highest bit of the 14 bit value is one).
//
// Note Bene: there's a Arduino Due sketch floating about the internet which
// gets this wrong and for negative temperatures generates incorrect values.
// E.g, -2047C for what should be -1C; -1798C for what should be -250C.  The
// values of -1C and -250C are shown as examples in Table 4 of the datasheet
// for the MAX21855.)  The incorrect Arduino Due sketch appears in, and may be
// from, the book Arduino Sketches: Tools and Techniques for Programming
// Wizardry, James A. Langbridge, January 12, 2015, John Wiley & Sons.

// Bits  -- Interpretation
// -----    -----------------------------------------------------------------
// 31:18 -- 14 bit, signed thermocouple temperature data.  Units of 0.25 C
//    17 -- Reserved
//    16 -- Fault indicator (1 if fault detected; 0 otherwise)
// 15:04 -- 12 bit, signed cold junction temperature data.  Units of 0.0625 C
//    03 -- Reserved
//    02 -- SCV fault; reads 1 if the thermocouple is shorted to Vcc
//    01 -- SCG fault; reads 1 if the thermocouple is shorted to ground
//    00 --  OC fault; reads 1 if the thermocouple is not connected (open)

// For purposes of setting bit transfer widths and timings, we need to use a
// Peripheral Channel Select (PCS).  Use channel #3 as it is unlikely to be
// used by anything else as the Arduino Due leaves pin 78 unconnected.
